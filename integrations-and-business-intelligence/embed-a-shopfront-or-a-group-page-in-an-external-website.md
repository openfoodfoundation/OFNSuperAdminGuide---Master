# Embed a group page in an external website

This feature lets users who have set up a [Group](../groups.md) in the OFN embed it into their own website. This gives customers a more fluid experience and avoids the need to redirect them between multiple websites. It also allows the group to retain some of its visual branding. While a group page can be embedded into an external site, the individual shops of the group members will still be opened on the OFN website.

If a user asks you for this feature, you need to add their domain in the whitelist of domains, as described in [General Settings](../ofn-platform-configuration/general-settings.md). Then they have one line of code to integrate in their website. The detailed steps to be carried out (including the code) are described in the OFN user guide on page [Embed a Group Page in a Website](https://guide.openfoodnetwork.org/basic-features/groups/embed-a-group-page).

This feature has the following limitations :

* There is no possibility to customize the visual aspect of the integrated group page in the external website, so it's not always easy to make it look good.

We hope when we move forward on improving the OFN API that we can move toward some more advanced features like fully integrated online shops. Stay tuned!
