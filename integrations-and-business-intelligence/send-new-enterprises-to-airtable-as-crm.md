# Send New Enterprises to Airtable as CRM

## Integrate OFN with Airtable

In Australia we are using Airtable as a basic CRM and on-boarding assistant. We are using Zapier to update Airtable when

* a new Enterprise is created in OFN
* an existing Enterprise changes Owner (so we can update contact details)

This doc shows roughly how we are using it as well as the zaps to do this (as at October 2019)

NB. This is very new, may not work and will definitely evolve. Worth checking with us if you are looking to emulate as canâ€™t promise this doc will be up to date

## Requirements

* Premium Zapier account (ask on the Zappiness slack channel for more details)
* PostgresDB connection in Zapier
