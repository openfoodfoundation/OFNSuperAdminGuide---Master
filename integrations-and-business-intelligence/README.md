# Integrations and business intelligence

For now the only available ready to use integration feature is the ability to [embed a group page](embed-a-shopfront-or-a-group-page-in-an-external-website.md) into an external website. It is a very basic integration, which will be explained on the next page.

Also, we have started to use Zapier to prototype and start with some basic integrations, until we have a more advanced API and a more refined integration strategy. So as a super-admin, there are some useful "zaps" you can create to make your life easier.

Currently the OFN API is incomplete. Thus, we use two different techniques to develop Zapier integrations in OFN.

1\) We connect the database to Zapier directly with read only queries. This requires some guidance from a System Administrator. If you would like to do this step please ask in the Zappiness slack channel to get started.

2\) We connect using our API. We have not developed integrations for all endpoints yet. We will add them as we go. The following instructions will get you started authenticating the OFN API in Zapier: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xe9uZTT9DIf1l3r8-sAxPDxE672kVU46123FLbDaC2o/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xe9uZTT9DIf1l3r8-sAxPDxE672kVU46123FLbDaC2o/edit).
