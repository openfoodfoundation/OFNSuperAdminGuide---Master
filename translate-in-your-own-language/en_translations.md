# Common EN Translations

Here are some things that English language instances commonly use translations to manage:

* Text throughout the entry, messaging pages etc
* Text within the automated emails e.g. Australia includes information about pricing in the Welcome emails 
* Improving clumsy / confusing wording in the code e.g.
  * Product and Variant details - [issue](https://github.com/openfoodfoundation/openfoodnetwork/issues/4788)
  * Product property inheritance - [issue](https://github.com/openfoodfoundation/openfoodnetwork/issues/4466)
