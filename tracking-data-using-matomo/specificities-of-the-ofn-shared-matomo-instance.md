# Specificities of the OFN shared Matomo instance

Matomo offers a large variety of analytics features. These features can be activated or deactivated given the context Matomo is used in.\
\
For now, OFN has chosen to restrict some functionnalities (live tracking, all IPs are anonymous,...) in order to enable instances to not use the OFN cookie consent banner.\
\
These restriction are listed here: [https://matomo.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Matomo-Analytics-Exemption-from-Tracking-Consent-in-France-CNIL.pdf](https://matomo.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Matomo-Analytics-Exemption-from-Tracking-Consent-in-France-CNIL.pdf)\
\
If the community wants to changes these settings to ease the use of the tool, they can remove instances who don't use consent banner from the tracking. Or ask these instances to re-activate their banner.\
