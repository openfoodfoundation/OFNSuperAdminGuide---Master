# Setting up a new Matomo Site

If there is no 'website' defined for your OFN instance in the global Matomo account, then you will need to create a new 'site'.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/mKWjaq9Z4Rr3UOPD3CTA2IQYt4KJWo4QcoloG1h5UOR4uCKUcLzhWeqjKTKTeEm7YO9D7d\_3VxA0IPA53aw4sj0ZQZvEmnvWxY-D0o68culnfurAmfgma7BqqyMGQjcfE0Zs-Qsd)

Click the 'Add new measurable' (red button). You will see this message:

Click on "Website". You will then have a form that starts like this:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

**If you want to set up quickly, here are the info you need to fill:**

**Name**: Indicate the name of your instance e.g. "OFN UK". Remember that all instances have the same access. Putting a clear name will help everyone to know what site is measured.

**URL**: Fill in the URL of you instance e.g. "[https://www.openfoodfrance.org](https://www.openfoodfrance.org)"

**Only track visits and actions when the action URL starts with one of the above URLs**: leave blank

**Keep Page URL fragments when tracking Page URLs**: leave No (Default)

**Excluded IPs**: leave blank

**Excluded parameters**: leave blank

**Excluded User agents**: leave blank

**Site search**: leave default site search enabled

**Ecommerce**: set to "ecommerce enabled" and choose the currency of your instance

**Time zone**: indicate the time zone of your instance

Save. Now you have a Site ID number that can be added to the [OFN Matomo Configuration](./)
