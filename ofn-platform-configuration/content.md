To get some existing html code and copy-paste-adapt it, ask another instance manager ! You can also reuse some infographics, like [this one](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B\_HDFsX1e\_2VQUlaTVBPcGVQR3M), that other instances use.

## Main menu links

Here you can select which menu items you want to include in your header menu.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Capture du 2019-05-27 20-22-28.png>)

The available menus are sources from Transifex so you need first to make sure you have properly translated them and added the right url ([see relevant paragraph in the translation section](https://ofn-user-guide.gitbook.io/ofn-super-admin-guide/translate-in-your-own-language#some-strings-that-you-need-to-be-careful-about)).

{% hint style="info" %}
The translations for those menu in Transifex is different from the other translations, so pay attention !&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Then, selecting an item turns it visible or invisible.

The name in the field is the name that identify the icons used on the hamburger menu when accessing the platform on a small screen, like a phone. You can ignore them.

**Links:** You can insert links to other pages, which will show under the ‘email us’, in the Keep in Touch column. E.g. "\[News]\(https://about.openfoodnetwork.org.uk/blog)" - this will create a link titled ‘News’, hyperlinked to[ ](http://openfoodnetwork.org/contact/)[https://about.openfoodnetwork.org.uk/blog](https://about.openfoodnetwork.org.uk/blog). \
**About URL:** Link to instance page on .org, or another website (example : [https://openfoodnetwork.org/ofn-local/open-food-network-australia/](https://openfoodnetwork.org/ofn-local/open-food-network-australia/)) . There's no place to create an extensive 'about us' page within the instance so when visitor clicks on "about" they will be redirected to that page.
