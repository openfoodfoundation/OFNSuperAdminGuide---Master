# Common Investigations (FAQs)

Below are some common scenarios that a Customer Support team member might have to investigate or find answers to. The table below shows where to find the answer in the OFN platform and where you can find more information in the User Guide. If you have a frequently asked question that is not covered, please add it below. 

If you have longer or more detailed information that will help others answer a question or investigate a problem (eg. an email template, a how-to guide), please add it to [Shared Resources](shared-resources/) and link to it in the **More Information** column below. 

To resolve most of the queries below, you should be logged in to OFN with an account that has Superadmin privileges OR as a Manager of an OFN Enterprise. See more information about [Using Superadmin](using-superadmin/) and [Add Yourself As A Manager of an Enterprise](using-superadmin/add-yourself-as-a-manager-of-an-enterprise.md)

| Can I change the owner of the account?                 | **Dashboard - Users** Before you can change the email address in the Owner field, you need to make that email address a Manager of the account. If the new email address is not already on OFN, you need to select ‘invite an unregistered user’ and wait for that person to confirm the email.                                                                     | [Change Profile Managers / Owners](https://guide.openfoodnetwork.org/basic-features/enterprise-profile/transfer-ownership)                                                      |
| Who set up the account?                                | **Dashboard - Users** Usually this is the owner, unless it has been changed since originally set up. Some profiles have been set up by a volunteer or someone at OFN, and if so, the Enterprises may not be aware their profile exists. Possible OFN owner email addresses in Aus are variations on: hello@openfoodentwork.org.au or helpers@openfoodnetwork.org.au |                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Who are the managers of the account?                   | **Dashboard - Users** Manager email address.
