# New Producer Sign Up

Hi

Welcome to the Open Food Network!

**YOUR ACCOUNT**

We noticed that you started creating a Producer Account with us recently and we wanted to let you know that we're here to help if you'd like a hand figuring out the best way to get your food into customers' hands. You can change your package to Hub if you want to sell products from more than one producer, or Profile Only if you’d rather not manage your own shop, but instead list your products for selling in someone else’s shop.

GETTING STARTED

**Book a demo**

If you'd like one of our team to show you around the back end of your new Open Food Network account and run through the basics of what it can do and how to navigate setup, reply to this email with your availability and we'll book in time to chat.

**Ready to get started now**

You can access and edit your shop settings by logging in to the Open Food Network and accessing the Administration panel. If you can’t find it, copy this link into your browser: [https://openfoodnetwork.org.au/admin/](https://openfoodnetwork.org.au/admin/).
