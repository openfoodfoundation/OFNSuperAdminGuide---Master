# The Customer Support Role

### What is the Customer Support Role?

In the Aus team we are currently working on defining the Customer Support Role. We'll add our insights here when that's done. Have you done this thinking already? Please share your thoughts!



### Comparing our Approaches

Let's get clear on what Customer support means to each Instance. Add your instance against each task you currently perform or propose to perform as part of your customer support offering
