# About the Divi theme & settings



General

* If/when page names are updated, please make sure slug/permalink is updated also.
* Currently top level categories with subcategories DO NOT have their own page content

Posts (aka Blog posts or News posts)

* All posts need a feature image - as this is displayed in the auto-populated ‘Latest News’ section.
* Ideally all projects should also have a category associated.
* Discussion (aka comments) is switched OFF.

Pages (aka static content pages, most which appear in the navigation + dropdowns)

* Discussion (aka comments) is switched OFF.
* If you want a page to appear in the navigation, use the Dashboard → Appearance → Menu to manage.

Projects (aka evergreen content pages like Case Studies, Research, Models, Resources)

* All projects need a feature image - as this is displayed in the auto-populated ‘Latest Case Studies’ section.
* Ideally all projects should also have a category associated.
* Discussion (aka comments) is  switched OFF.

Resources

* Featured section currently pulls the latest project from each category.
* Featured section is hidden on Tablet and Mobile to prevent user confusion in a single column presentation.
* Search field will look for the search term in pages + posts + projects and it isn’t the smartest search (we can improve on this in some custom dev work in the future) You can isolate search to only search pages or only search posts, but NOT to only search projects (aka, what we use for resources). Suggestions for improvements on this are welcome
* Standard content section will show 8 items, then paginate the rest

Custom Fonts

* The Elegant Theme Icon font will needed to be uploaded to the Divi Theme if a wordpress site wants access to the icon library. The font comes free with the Divi Theme account.
* Instructions for uploading the font can be found here: [https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/resources/elegant-icon-font](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/resources/elegant-icon-font)
