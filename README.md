# Overview

Congratulations! You have deployed the OFN code base on a server and are ready to start playing with it :-)

This Guide is for people who are setting up, hosting and managing their own instance of the Open Food Network. Once installed and running, we refer to you as Super-Admin.

There are a couple of things you need to configure to get all the power out of this piece of code:

* [Configuration Basics](ofn-platform-configuration/)
* [Producer and products properties](producer-and-product-properties.md)
* [Managing users](managing-users.md)
* [Groups](groups.md)

Also for your website to work in your local language and make your instance multi-lingual, you'll find everything [here](translate-in-your-own-language/).

You can also [create your own localized version of the OFN Gitbook user guide](set-up-your-user-guide.md).

And last but not least, you will learn [how to create "zaps"](integrations-and-business-intelligence/) to integrate the OFN with some external systems like invoicing or newsletter tools, and get business intelligence data you might need to operate properly your instance.

This guide book takes you step by step on your journey to set up you OFN instance as a super-admin. We won't talk about developers / system administration stuff here, for that please see our [github wiki](https://github.com/openfoodfoundation/openfoodnetwork/wiki).
